== Rubygame 2.4.0

Release focus: Events.

=== Features

- New Events module, with a suite of new and revised event classes.
  The new classes offer full functionality as the older classes.

  - Use Rubygame::EventQueue#enable_new_style_events to enable the new
    event classes. This will become the default in Rubygame 3.0.

  - Uses symbols instead of integer constants for keyboard keys and
    mouse buttons (e.g. :a, :space, :mouse_left, :mouse_right).

  - Better unicode / international keyboard text input support.
    (See Rubygame::Events::KeyPressed#string)

  - More natural and memorable class naming scheme.

- New hook-based event handling system.
  (NOTE: Requires use of the new event classes.)

  - Rubygame::EventHandler class.
    EventHandler holds many EventHook instances. It handles each event
    by passing it to matching hooks.

  - Rubygame::EventHandler::HasEventHandler mixin module.
    Include this in your custom classes to add easy event handling
    and event hook creation abilities.

  - Rubygame::EventHook class.
    
  - Rubygame::EventActions module.
    Has several pre-made event action classes to use with EventHook.

  - Rubygame::EventTriggers module.
    Has several pre-made event trigger classes to use with EventHook.

- Added Rubygame.enable_key_repeat and Rubygame.disable_key_repeat.
  Thanks to atiaxi for this new feature!

=== Fixes

- Fixed: EventQueue#peek_each didn't yield any events.

- Fixed: Segfault in extract_rgba_u8_as_u8() on x86_64 systems.
  Thanks to ElCuGo for this fix!

- Fixed: Several "cast from pointer" warnings on x86_64 systems.

- Fixed: Build system didn't correctly compile with debug symbols
  when using "debug" option.

- Fixed: Surface#get_at didn't work correctly for 8-bit Surfaces.

- Fixed: Ftor.new_from_to would always complain about "wrong number
  of arguments". Thanks to atiaxi for this fix!

=== Other Stuff

- The panda demo (samples/demo_rubygame.rb) has been renovated to
  demonstrate how to use the new features, and to be a better example.

- Old event classes are deprecated and will be removed in 3.0.
  - ActiveEvent      (use Events::InputFocusGained,
                          Events::InputFocusLost,

                          Events::MouseFocusLost,
                          Events::WindowMinimized, and
                          Events::WindowUnminimized)

  - Rubygame::Mixer module and methods are deprecated.
  - Rubygame::Mixer::Music class is deprecated.
    Use Rubygame::Music class instead.
  - Rubygame::Mixer::Sample class is deprecated.
    Use Rubygame::Sound class instead.
  - Rubygame::Surface.load_image is deprecated.
    Use Rubygame::Surface.load instead.

- NOTE: Run ruby with -w flag or set $_v = true to enable run-time
  deprecation warnings.




== Rubygame 2.2.0

Release focus: Colors.

=== Features

- Add: Rubygame::Color module
  - ColorRGB, ColorHSV, and ColorHSL classes.
  - X11 and CSS palettes of pre-defined colors.

  - Automatic lookup of color names when a string or symbol
    is passed for a color to Surface methods.
- Add: Surface#set_at().

- Add: Screen#icon=().

=== Bug Fixes

- Fix: Surface#draw_arc was incorrectly documented as Surface#draw_pie

=== Improvements

- Rect#collide_rect? is now faster.
- Sprites::Group#collide_group can take a block; arguments are deprecated.

=== Other Stuff

- Build system correctly recompiles if source has changed.
- Build system option syntax has changed. See the README: Advanced Install.
- Build system will correctly exit with an error status if it can't compile;

- Fix: Build system doesn't correctly handle quoted spaces in --cflags/--lflags.
  (NOTE: Use CFLAGS/LDFLAGS environment variables now, instead.)
